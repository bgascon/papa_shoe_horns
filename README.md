Papa's Shoe Horns makes high-quality 100% stainless steel shoehorns in a variety of lengths.  
Locally made in Portland, Oregon.

This project is a re-build of the existing Papa's Shoe Horns website with the main goals of updating the style, integrating Shopify for ease-of-use for the customer, and increasing product clarity.

## Project Status
> Incomplete

Currently in the research and design phase.

## Project Overview

The current [site](www.papashoehorns.com) is a simple, and somewhat unappealing wordpress site that I wanted to modernize and hopefully implement Shopify to eliminate the need to purchase through PayPal. I want to showcase the unique backstory of the brand and streamline the entire site into less pages, leading to less clicks to navigate through the site.

## Project Design
### Initial Process

One of the first things I do is create some rough layout sketches to place elements and get a feel for the user interaction.

\
\
### Detailed Wireframes
After a rough layout, I put together a more refined wireframe layout in Adobe XD.
\
All layouts started with a full-page height header with the logo, and a tagline\
