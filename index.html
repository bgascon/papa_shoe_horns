            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Papa’s Shoe Horns was founded July of 2014. However, our history runs much deeper… January 15, 1923 on Union Pacific Rail Road outfitter car #01058, the inspiration for Papa’s Shoe Horns LLC was born. His father was a foreman for the U.P.R.R. and so car #01058 served as a home for the first several years of his young life, pulling him and his family from place to place, wherever needed.</p>
            <p>As Arthur Delbuono or “Papa” grew so did his affinity for metal. During his adolescent years he spent many hours frequenting the nearby junk yards searching for metals that could be sold for scrap. Ultimately, his passion for metal lead him to a career as a Ship Outfitter in the U.S. Navy, where he served in WWII and the Korean war. Post war Papa returned home to his wife, two daughters, and a lifelong career as a sheet metal fabricator.</p>
            <p>As Papa aged into his 50’s and 60’s it became increasingly difficult to put his shoes on with a standard shoehorn. It was this struggle that lead him to the extension of the regular shoehorn, which would allow him to remain standing while putting his shoes on. After 40+ years using his long handle shoehorn, he will not be caught without one. Now we have the opportunity to share it with everyone.</p>
